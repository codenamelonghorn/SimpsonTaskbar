.SYNOPSIS
    Builds the Win7Taskbar release package: self-contained, Windows x64.

.DESCRIPTION
    Produces a folder that runs on a Windows 10/11 x64 machine with no .NET
    installed at all:

        1. builds the native core (CMake)          -> dist/*.dll
        2. publishes the WPF app, self-contained    -> dist-package/
        3. copies the remaining native DLLs and the launcher note
        4. verifies that the package really is self-contained
        5. optionally zips it

    The Windows forms of the same steps are also in the GitHub workflow
    (.github/workflows/release.yml), which calls this script.

.EXAMPLE
    pwsh -File "compilation files/publish.ps1"
    pwsh -File "compilation files/publish.ps1" -Zip
    pwsh -File "compilation files/publish.ps1" -SkipNative          # reuse an existing dist/

.NOTES
    Requires: .NET 8 SDK, CMake + a C++ toolchain (MSVC, or MinGW-w64 when
    cross-compiling from Linux/macOS).
